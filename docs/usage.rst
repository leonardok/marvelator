Marvelator is an abstraction to the marvel API. It is just a lib that you can use instead of issuing raw calls to the
developer api.

To use marvelator in a project::

	from marvelator.characters_resource import CharactersResource
	from marvelator.comics_resource import ComicsResource

Those are, at this point, the available APIs for you to use.
